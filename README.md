# Image to Audio Story

This project turns an image into an audio story. It uses Hugging Face models for image captioning and story generation, and the resulting story is converted into audio using an ESPnet model.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sona3ms/img_into_audio_story.git
2. Set up Hugging Face API key
   Refer to the Hugging Face documentation for more information.
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   streamlit run app.py
4. Upload an image through the Streamlit UI and listen to the generated audio story.
